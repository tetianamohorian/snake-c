# 🐍 Snake Game in C

A classic Snake game implemented in the C programming language. Designed to run in a terminal environment, this project demonstrates fundamental C skills, modular design, and real-time input handling.

## 🎮 Features

- Classic Snake game mechanics
- Real-time movement and collision detection
- Modular code architecture (snake logic, world generation, main control loop)
- Easy build and run using Makefile
- Console-based interface

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- C (C99)
- GCC
- Make (GNU Make)

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── main.c          # Main loop and game initialization
├── snake.c/.h      # Snake movement, growth, and collisions
├── world.c/.h      # Game field and food generation
├── Makefile        # Build configuration
├── README.md       # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

2. **Run the game**:
   ```bash
   ./snake
   ```

3. **Clean build files**:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated

- Low-level memory and pointer management
- Structs and modular file design
- Handling terminal-based real-time input
- Compilation and build automation with Makefile
